# Turtle-Simulator

## Introduction

Turtle Simulator is a small educational program that allows users to control a turtle to draw shapes on the screen using simple commands. It's designed to be an interactive and fun way to learn basic programming and graphical concepts. The turtle can draw basic shapes like triangles, squares, rectangles, circles, and polygons (up to 10 sides). Users can control the turtle using either the arrow keys on the screen or the keyboard. The turtle is capable of drawing lines as it moves, which can be toggled on or off, and the turtle icon itself can be hidden. Additionally, users can customize the color and width of the lines drawn by the turtle.
